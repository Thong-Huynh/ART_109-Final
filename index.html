      <h1>Past-Present-Future</h1>
      <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
      <p class="text">For this project, I create a site to showcase a breakdown of a motion design project I completed
        in other
        class this semester. The project is inspired by the Japanese elements (bonsai, fuurin - wind chime, koi
        fish,...) and Zen philosophy to visualize a warm summer breeze. The vintage film style to convey a nostalgic and
        historical sense of the time that has been long gone. In the website, I set up a space with light
        background
        wrapped around by a geometric net-texture to give impression of a futuristic look that suggests a space or a
        domain inside one's mind. Player, who represents the present, will be able to move around a space with one
        straight path
        that contains layers of images, and walk through them in the same way that one might look through layers of cut
        out papers or just as the experience of riding a amusement ride.</p>
